# MTG-API-project

This project was the creation of a search engine that specialized in finding magic the gathering cards based on a variety of input fields the user has access to. The technology used to make this project were html, css, and javascript for the base coding langages. Bootstrap and https://magicthegathering.io/ as an api that held the data of all the cards.

I learned a lot during the creation of this project. for starters I learned how to use an api and got confortable reading docs about them as well as bootstrap. I also learned a lot more about local storage and accessing web pages using javascript with queryselectors and appending for example. Other parts of java script I got more comfortable with include some more advanced syntax as well as moving from one page to another. It also taught me home much I really have left to learn as I know I can streamline the way the code searches through the data provided by the API as well as even just accessing the API in general. I also think I could do a lot more with bootstrap and css to make the website look prettier.
